<h2>Installation</h2>

This app requires 
<em>
  <ul>
    <li>Ruby</li>
    <li>Rails</li>
    <li>Node</li>
  </ul></em>
  
  After you fork and clone this repository, <br />
  Open 2 terminal windows (one for back-end, one for front-end)<br /> <br/>
  For the back-end intended teminal, enter <code>cd MotiveRate-Api/</code> from the repo directory<br />
  For the front-end intended teminal, enter <code>cd motiverate-client/</code> from the repo directory<br />
  
  <h4>Back-End</h4>
  <p>
  You will have to initialize the database and seed data before launching the rails server. <br />
  Enter these commands in your back-end terminal window.
</p>

  
  ```
  $ bundle install
  $ rails db:migrate:reset db:seed
  $ rails s
  ```
  
  <br />
  
  <h4>Front-End</h4>
  <p>
Once you enter these commands in your front-end terminal window, the app should automatically <br />
launch, I hope you enjoy it!

</p>

```
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

<em>
NOTE: <br />
  <p>
    It is recommended to make two user accounts to best demo the 'user update support' feature
  </p>
