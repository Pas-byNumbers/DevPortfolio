    <h4>Bio</h4>
      <p>I have always been an avid explorer within various fields of technology. 
      <br />
      Building custom PCs with my dad and tinkering
      with homebrew 
      applications on my games consoles when I was<br /> young eventually led to a strong enthusiasm towards how technology works.</p>
      <p>
       I also developed a passion towards creating music with both hardware and software, seeing how technology fits within<br /> other industries, eventually leading to my own business where I extended my services to support aspiring artists.
      </p>
      <p>
        My past experiences have revealed to me the many possibilities that computer code can bring to the world.
        <br />
        So today, I program applications because i'm curious as to how I can help make those possibilities happen.
